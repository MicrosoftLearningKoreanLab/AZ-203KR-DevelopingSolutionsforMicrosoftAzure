# Lab: Access resource secrets securely across services
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **CloudBlobContainer.GetBlockBlobReference** method, while passing in the **records.json** blob name to create a new instance of the **CloudBlockBlob** class that references the blob that you uploaded earlier in this lab:

    ```
    CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("records.json");
    ```
    
1.  The **Run** method should now look like this:

    ```
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        CloudStorageAccount account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("drop");
        CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("records.json");
    }
    ```

#### Task 4: Download a blob

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **CloudBlockBlob.DownloadTextAsync** method to download the contents of the referenced blob asynchronously and store the result in a string variable named *content*:

    ```
    string content = await blob.DownloadTextAsync();
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to return the value of the *content* variable by using the **OkObjectResult** class constructor:

    ```
    return new OkObjectResult(content);
    ```

1.  The **Run** method should now look like this:

    ```
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        CloudStorageAccount account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("drop");
        CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("records.json");
        string content = await blob.DownloadTextAsync();
        return new OkObjectResult(content);
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test execution of the function.

1.  Observe the **Output** text box in the **Test** pane. You should now see the content of the **$/drop/records.json** blob stored in your **storage account**.

#### Task 5: Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS)

1.  **Delete** the following lines of code:

    ```
    string content = await blob.DownloadTextAsync();

    return new OkObjectResult(content);
    ```

1.  The **Run** method should now look like this:

    ```
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob;
    
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        CloudStorageAccount account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("drop");
        CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("records.json");
    }
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to create a new instance of the **SharedAccessPolicy** class with the following settings:
    
      - **Permission**: Read
    
      - **Service Scope**: Blob
    
      - **Resource Types**: Object
    
      - **Expiration Time**: 2 Hours
    
      - **Protocol:** HTTPS Only

    ```
    SharedAccessAccountPolicy policy = new SharedAccessAccountPolicy()
    {
        Permissions = SharedAccessAccountPermissions.Read,
        Services = SharedAccessAccountServices.Blob,
        ResourceTypes = SharedAccessAccountResourceTypes.Object,
        SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(2),
        Protocols = SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly
    };
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **CloudStorageAccount.GetSharedAcessSignature** method to generate a new **Shared Access Signature (SAS) token** by using the provided policy, and then store the result in a string variable named *sasToken*:

    ```
    string sasToken = account.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy);
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to concatenate the value of the **CloudBlockBlob.Uri** property and the *sasToken* string variable, and store the result in a new variable named *secureBlobUrl*:

    ```
    string secureBlobUrl = $"{blob.Uri}{sasToken}";
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to return the value of the *secureBlobUrl* variable by using the **OkObjectResult** class constructor:

    ```
    return new OkObjectResult(secureBlobUrl);
    ```

1.  The **Run** method should now look like this:

    ```
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        CloudStorageAccount account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("drop");
        CloudBlockBlob blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("records.json");
        SharedAccessAccountPolicy policy = new SharedAccessAccountPolicy()
        {
            Permissions = SharedAccessAccountPermissions.Read,
            Services = SharedAccessAccountServices.Blob,
            ResourceTypes = SharedAccessAccountResourceTypes.Object,
            SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(2),
            Protocols = SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly
        };
        string sasToken = account.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy);
        string secureBlobUrl = $"{blob.Uri}{sasToken}";
        return new OkObjectResult(secureBlobUrl);
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test execution of the function.

1.  Observe the **Output** text box in the **Test** pane. You should now see a unique **Secure URL** that can be used to access the secured blob. Record this **URL** because you will need to use it in the next step of this lab.

1. On the taskbar, right-select the **Microsoft Edge** icon and then select **New window**.

1. In the new browser window, navigate to the **Secure** **URL** that you copied for the blob.

1. You should now see the **JSON** contents of the blob. Close the browser window showing the **JSON** contents.

1. Return to the browser window with the **Azure portal.**

#### Review

In this exercise, you used C\# code to access a storage account securely, download the contents of a blob, and then generate a SAS token that can be used to access the blob securely on another client.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the top navigation bar in the Azure Portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource group

1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to delete the **SecureFunction** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name SecureFunction --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active application

> Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
