# Lab: Building a web application on Azure Platform-as-a-Service offerings
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up.

The Microsoft Worldwide Learning team updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

1. Back in the **View files** tab, select the **run.csx** file to return to the editor for the **ImageManager** function.

1. Minimize the **View files** tab.

    > **Note**: You can minimize the tab by selecting the arrow immediately to the right of the tab header.

1. In the function editor, observe the example function script:

    ```
    public static void Run(Stream myBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} Bytes");
    }
    ```

1. **Delete** all the example code.

1. Within the editor, copy and paste the following placeholder function:

    ```
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Select **Save** to save the script and compile the code.

1. Add the following line of code within the **Run** method to log information about the function execution:

    ```
    log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");
    ```

1. Add the following **using** block to load the **Stream** for the input blob into the image library:

    ```
    using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
    {
    }
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code within the **using** block to mutate the image by resizing the image and applying a grayscale filter:

    ```
    image.Mutate(i => 	
        i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
    );
    ```

1. Add the following line of code to save the new image to the **Stream** for the output blob:

    ```
    image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());
    ```

1. Your **Run** method should now resemble this:

    ```
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Processing;
    using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.Jpeg;
    using SixLabors.Primitives;
    
    public static void Run(Stream inputBlob, Stream outputBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBlob.Length} Bytes");
        using (Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load(inputBlob))
        {
            image.Mutate(i => 	
                i.Resize(new ResizeOptions { Size = new Size(250, 250), Mode = ResizeMode.Max }).Grayscale()
            );
            image.Save(outputBlob, new JpegEncoder());
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select **Save** to save the script and compile the code again.
