# Lab: Constructing a polyglot data solution
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes following the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

1.  In the JSON object, in line 4, locate the **ConnectionStrings.AdventureWorksRedisContext** path. Observe that the current value is empty:

    ```
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        ...
        "AdventureWorksRedisContext": ""
    },
    ```

1.  Update the value of the **AdventureWorksRedisContext** property by setting its value to the **Primary connection string (StackExchange.Redis)** of the **Azure Cache for Redis** instance that you recorded earier in this lab.

1.  In the JSON object, in line 9, locate the **Settings.CartAvailable** path. Observe that the current value is **false**:

    ```
    "Settings": {
        ...
        "CartAvailable": false,
        ...
    }
    ```

1.  Update the value of the **CartAvailable** property by setting its value to **true**:

    ```
    "CartAvailable": true,
    ```

1.  Save the **appsettings.json** file.

#### Task 4: Update .NET application startup logic

1.  In the **Explorer** pane of the Visual Studio Code window, expand the **AdventureWorks.Web** project.

1.  Double-click (or double-select) the **Startup.cs** file.

1.  In the **Startup** class, locate the existing **ConfigureCheckoutService** method:

    ```
    public void ConfigureCheckoutService(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddScoped<IAdventureWorksCheckoutContext>(provider =>
            new Mock<IAdventureWorksCheckoutContext>().Object
        );
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: The current checkout service uses a mock as its database.

1.  Within the **ConfigureCheckoutService** method, delete all existing lines of code :

    ```
    public void ConfigureCheckoutService(IServiceCollection services)
    {
    }
    ```

1.  Within the **ConfigureCheckoutService** method, add the following block of code to change the checkout provider to the **AdventureWorksRedisContext** implementation you created earlier in this lab:

    ```
    services.AddScoped<IAdventureWorksCheckoutContext, AdventureWorksRedisContext>(provider =>
        new AdventureWorksRedisContext(
            _configuration.GetConnectionString(nameof(AdventureWorksRedisContext))
        )
    );
    ```

1.  Save the **Startup.cs** file.

#### Task 5: Validate .NET application successfully connects to Azure Cache for Redis

1.  In the Visual Studio Code window, access the context menu or right-click the **Explorer** pane and then select **Open in Terminal**.

1.  In the open command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter to switch your terminal context to the **AdventureWorks.Web** folder:

    ```
    cd .\AdventureWorks.Web\
    ```

1.  In the command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter to run the .NET Core web application:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: The ``dotnet run`` command will automatically build any changes to the project and then start the web application without a debugger attached. The command will output the URL of the running application and any assigned ports.

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1.  In the open browser window, navigate to the your currently running web application (<http://localhost:5000>).

1.  In the web application, observe the list of models displayed on the front page.

1.  Locate the **Mountain-400-W** model and select **View Details**.

1.  On the **Mountain-400-W** product detail page, perform the following actions:

    1.  In the **Select options** list, select **Mountain-400-W Silver, 40, $769.49**.
    
    1.  Select **Add to Cart**.

1.  On the shopping cart page, observe the contents of the cart and then select **Checkout**.

1.  On the checkout page, observe the final receipt.

1.  Select the **Shopping Cart** icon at the top of the page.

1.  On the shopping cart page, observe the empty cart.

1.  Close the browser window showing your web application.

1.  Back in the **Visual Studio Code** window, select the **Trash Can** icon to dispose of the currently open terminal and any associated processes.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used C# code to store and retrieve data from an Azure Cache for Redis store.

### Exercise 7: Clean up subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  At the top of the portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```
1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to delete the **PolyglotData** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name PolyglotData --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

1.  Close the currently running **Visual Studio Code** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
