# Lab: Deploying compute workloads by using images and containers
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

    1.  Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before moving forward with the lab.

    >Note: If you do not see the configuration options for the **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written from the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, **paste** the command you copied earlier in this lab and press Enter to connect to your new VM by using SSH.

    > **Note**: This command will be dependent on your username and IP address. For example, if the username is **Student** and the IP address is **40.125.245.5**, the command would be **ssh Student@40.125.245.5**.

1.  The SSH tool will first inform you that the authenticity of the host can’t be established and then ask if you want to continue connecting. Enter **yes** in the prompt and then press Enter to continue connecting to the VM.

1. The SSH tool will then ask you for a password. Enter **StudentPa55w.rd** and then press Enter to authenticate with the VM.

    > **Note**: Characters do not show when typing password. Please be advised.

1. After you are connected to the VM by using SSH, you will see a prompt for the Bash shell in the VM. In the prompt, type in the following command and press Enter to view the computer name of the Linux VM:

    ```
    uname -mnipo
    ```

12. In the prompt, type in the following command and press Enter to view information about the distribution and operating system of the Linux VM.

    ```
    uname -srv
    ```

13. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

    ```

1. Type the following command and press Enter to connect to the VM that you created earlier in this lab by using the SSH tool and the IP address stored in the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```
    ssh student@$ipAddress
    ```

1. The **SSH** tool will first inform you that the authenticity of the host can’t be established and then ask if you want to continue connecting. Enter **yes** and then press Enter to continue connecting to the VM.

1. The **SSH** tool will then ask you for a password. Enter **StudentPa55w.rd** and then press Enter to authenticate with the VM.

1. After you connect to the VM using SSH, type the following command and press Enter to view metadata describing the Linux VM:

    ```
    uname -a
    ```

#### Task 4: Validate that the container instance ran successfully

1.  On the navigation menu located on the left side of the portal, select the **Resource groups** link.

1.  In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **ContainerCompute** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **ContainerCompute** blade, select the **manualcompute** container instance that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Container Instance** blade, locate the **Settings** section and select the **Containers** link.

1.  In the **Containers** section, observe the list of **Events**.

1.  Select the **Logs** tab and observe the text logs from the container instance.
> **Note**: You can also optionally view the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

> **Note**: After the application finished executing, the container was terminated because it had completed its work.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were also able to customize the deployment further and execute task-based applications as part of a container run.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  At the top of the portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to delete the **ContainerCompute** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name ContainerCompute --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
