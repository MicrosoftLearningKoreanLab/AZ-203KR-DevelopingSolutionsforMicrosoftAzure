# Lab: Building a web application on Azure Platform-as-a-Service offerings
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You are the owner of a startup organization and have been building an image gallery application for people to share great images of food. To get your product to market as quickly as possible, you decided to use Microsoft Azure App Service to host your web applications and APIs. Recently, you realized that the images that are being uploaded to your application are simply too large. Out of concern for storage and bandwidth costs, you decided to use Azure Functions to process images in the background and shrink them down to thumbnails that can be loaded quickly.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

  - Create various apps by using the Azure App Service.

  - Configure application settings for an app.

  - Deploy apps by using Kudu, the Azure CLI, and zip deployment.

  - Author a function app to process Azure Storage images.
